   <h2> "Chapter 1</h2>
   <p>History of the PC" <br>
    
   <p> "The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617
   when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages
    from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet.
    Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012
    Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT."

    <h2> Chapter 2 </h2>
    <p> PC Components" <br>
    <p> <p>
    First off, let us start with a simple question. What is a PC? Most PCs are based off of the idea of IBM's PC released in
    1984. The next question is who controls the software. The not so surprising answer is Microsoft for the operating system (OS) <p>
    A lot of the difference between a PC and Mac comes down to the OS that the computer runs. Mac is unique (besides the style) is <p>
    the ability to run OS X. <p>
    <p> Next is the Hardware, and it may surprise some that Intel dominates the entire worldwide semiconductor industry. Intel is <p>
    bigger then Samsung and AMD.  Next is a White box. A term that you may not recognize, but you may already now. A white box is a generic PC that "assembled from a
     collection of industry-standard, commercially available components. These companies do not manufacture systems, they assemble <p>
     them.   <p> System types. Most go by two different ways to categorize them. One is by design/width of the processor bus and the width of the internal <p>
    registers. <p>

<h2> Chapter 3 </h2>
<p> Processor types
Processors has changed quite a bit since the first PC that came out in 1981, and the evolution has
focused on 4 points.
<li> Increasing the transitor count and dencity </li>
<li> Increasing the clock speed</li>
<li> Increasing the size of internal bits </li>
<li> Increasing the number of cores </li>

<p> In 1985 Intel came out with Intel 386 processor. It had a 32-bit architecture and 275,000 transitors. 
This chip could do more then five million instructions per second. In 1989 Intel released the 486 processor. The 486 processor had 1.2 million trnasistors and the first ever built-in
math comprocessor. Then in 1993 Intel again released the first P5 Family called Pentiumm setting new performance standards with the performance
of the previous 486 processor. P6, the first processor in the (686) family, called the Pentuim Pro was introduced in 1995.
AMD introduced the Athlon in 1999 to compete with Intel in the high-end desktop PC market.
2002 saw Intel release Pentuim 4 running at 3.06 GHz, the first processor to break the 3GHz barrier. In 2003 AMD released
the first 64-bit PC processor: Athlon 64.In 2005 both Intel and AMD released the first dual-core processor.
2006 Intel reviled a new processor family called the Core 2, and this was mostly baed off of previous M/Core processors.
AMD released the Phenom 2 series, and Intel came out with the "Sandy Bridge", second generation of Core i-series.
In 2012 Intel put out the third generation Core i-series. As a side note, AMD processors are used by many companies as well as used in non-Windows smartphones.

<h2> Chapter 4 Motherboards</h2>
<p> <p>
<p>The motherboards are a major component of a computer, everything connects it determines what you can do and how fast you can do it.
The ATX has improved on the Baby-AT and LDX motherboard designs, such as:
<li> Built in high external I/O connector pannel</li>
<li> Single main keyed internal power supply connector</li>
<li> Relocated CPU and memory </li>
<li> Relocated internal I/O connectors </li>
<li> Improved cooling </li>
<li> Lower cost to manufacture</li>
   
     <p> <p>
     The ATX form factor was a long stride away from the motherboard form factos in the past. ATX combined what was considered the best from Baby-AT and LPX motherboard, with
     new features put in. The placement also changed, the motherboard was placed futher away from the drive bay, making the CPU, memory, and internal drive 
     made it simple to access and not mess up the bus slots. The physical componets are as follows:
     <li> The full size ATX is 12 inches wide and 9.6 inches deep. (305mmx244mm)
     <li> By contrast the Mini-ATX board is 11.2 inches and 8.2 inches. (284mmx208mm)
     
     <p> If you go to www.formfactors.org you can get spects and more information on ATX.<p>
  
  <h2> Chapter 5 BIOS</h2>
  <p> <p>
  <p> BIOS is an acronym that stands for basic input/output system. Most people know ir as device drivers or simply drivers.
  There are three main types of BIOS.
  <li> Motherboard ROM<\li>
  <li> Adapter card ROMs (found on video card)a<\li>
  <li> Loaded into RAM from disk(device Drivers)<\li>
  
  <p><p>
  POST (power on self test) loads an OS (operating system) then calls on low-level routines to interact with system hardware.
  <p> The motherboard ROM (read-only memory) compines any adapter card ROMs, and puts it in with the collective functionality.<p>
  <p> Drivers are loaded from a disk to RAM and then joined in BIOS so that it is there if needed. Memory is memory (to your computer) so as long as a routine exist and is known, the computer will use it.<p>
  <p><p>
  The BIOS id s mix of the motherboard ROM and adapter card ROM, and the device drivers loaded from a disk into RAM. Adding in new drivers to
  ROM is tricky, as they are hard to change and have limited amount of space. The PC architecture only holds up to 256KB max amount of ROM space.<p>
  <p>Applications talk to the OS by what is called application programming interface (API). API is different depending on your OS/ API only interacts with
  the OS, not the hardware. The OS then comunicates with BIOS in the driver layer. As many know, a OS can run on any type of hardware.
  The most differnce between the hardware is the system itself. BIOS covers up what the difference is.<p>
