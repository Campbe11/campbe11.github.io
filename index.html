   <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
   <p>History of the PC" <br>
    
   <p> "The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617
   when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages
    from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet.
    Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012
    Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT."

    <h2> Chapter 2 </h2>
    <p> PC Components" <br>
    <p> <p>
    First off, let us start with a simple question. What is a PC? Most PCs are based off of the idea of IBM's PC released in
    1984. The next question is who controls the software. The not so surprising answer is Microsoft for the operating system (OS) 
    A lot of the difference between a PC and Mac comes down to the OS that the computer runs. Mac is unique (besides the style) is 
    the ability to run OS X. <p>
    <p> Next is the Hardware, and it may surprise some that Intel dominates the entire worldwide semiconductor industry. Intel is 
    bigger then Samsung and AMD.  Next is a White box. A term that you may not recognize, but you may already now. A white box is a generic PC that "assembled from a
     collection of industry-standard, commercially available components. These companies do not manufacture systems, they assemble them.   <p> System types. Most go by two different ways to categorize them. 
     One is by design/width of the processor bus and the width of the internal registers. <p>

    <p>*These may be on the motherboard or processor.
    

<h2> Chapter 3 </h2>
<p> Processor types
Processors has changed quite a bit since the first PC that came out in 1981, and the evolution has
focused on 4 points.
<li> Increasing the transitor count and dencity </li>
<li> Increasing the clock speed</li>
<li> Increasing the size of internal bits </li>
<li> Increasing the number of cores </li>

<p> In 1985 Intel came out with Intel 386 processor. It had a 32-bit architecture and 275,000 transitors. 
This chip could do more then five million instructions per second. In 1989 Intel released the 486 processor. The 486 processor had 1.2 million trnasistors and the first ever built-in
math comprocessor. Then in 1993 Intel again released the first P5 Family called Pentiumm setting new performance standards with the performance
of the previous 486 processor. P6, the first processor in the (686) family, called the Pentuim Pro was introduced in 1995.
AMD introduced the Athlon in 1999 to compete with Intel in the high-end desktop PC market.
2002 saw Intel release Pentuim 4 running at 3.06 GHz, the first processor to break the 3GHz barrier. In 2003 AMD released
the first 64-bit PC processor: Athlon 64.In 2005 both Intel and AMD released the first dual-core processor.
2006 Intel reviled a new processor family called the Core 2, and this was mostly baed off of previous M/Core processors.
AMD released the Phenom 2 series, and Intel came out with the "Sandy Bridge", second generation of Core i-series.
In 2012 Intel put out the third generation Core i-series. As a side note, AMD processors are used by many companies as well as used in non-Windows smartphones.

<h2> Chapter 4 Motherboards</h2>
<p> <p>
<p>The motherboards are a major component of a computer, everything connects it determines what you can do and how fast you can do it.
The ATX has improved on the Baby-AT and LDX motherboard designs, such as:
<li> Built in high external I/O connector pannel</li>
<li> Single main keyed internal power supply connector</li>
<li> Relocated CPU and memory </li>
<li> Relocated internal I/O connectors </li>
<li> Improved cooling </li>
<li> Lower cost to manufacture</li>
   
     <p> <p>
     The ATX form factor was a long stride away from the motherboard form factos in the past. ATX combined what was considered the best from Baby-AT and LPX motherboard, with
     new features put in. The placement also changed, the motherboard was placed futher away from the drive bay, making the CPU, memory, and internal drive 
     made it simple to access and not mess up the bus slots. The physical componets are as follows:
     <li> The full size ATX is 12 inches wide and 9.6 inches deep. (305mmx244mm)
     <li> By contrast the Mini-ATX board is 11.2 inches and 8.2 inches. (284mmx208mm)
     
     <p> If you go to www.formfactors.org you can get spects and more information on ATX.<p>
  
  <h2> Chapter 5 BIOS</h2>
  <p> <p>
  <p> BIOS is an acronym that stands for basic input/output system. Most people know ir as device drivers or simply drivers.
  There are three main types of BIOS.
  <li> Motherboard ROM<\li>
  <li> Adapter card ROMs (found on video card)a<\li>
  <li> Loaded into RAM from disk(device Drivers)<\li>
  
  <p><p>
  POST (power on self test) loads an OS (operating system) then calls on low-level routines to interact with system hardware.
  <p> The motherboard ROM (read-only memory) compines any adapter card ROMs, and puts it in with the collective functionality.<p>
  <p> Drivers are loaded from a disk to RAM and then joined in BIOS so that it is there if needed. Memory is memory (to your computer) so as long as a routine exist and is known, the computer will use it.<p>
  <p><p>
  The BIOS id s mix of the motherboard ROM and adapter card ROM, and the device drivers loaded from a disk into RAM. Adding in new drivers to
  ROM is tricky, as they are hard to change and have limited amount of space. The PC architecture only holds up to 256KB max amount of ROM space.<p>
  <p>Applications talk to the OS by what is called application programming interface (API). API is different depending on your OS/ API only interacts with
  the OS, not the hardware. The OS then comunicates with BIOS in the driver layer. As many know, a OS can run on any type of hardware.
  The most differnce between the hardware is the system itself. BIOS covers up what the difference is.<p>
  <p> <p>
  <p><p>
  <h2> Chapter 6 Memory</h2>
  <p> The memory of a computer is something that is important for any computer. Memory is often where the processor is working at any given time.
  The main memory of any computer is RAM (Random Access Memory), which as the name imples, can be accessed randomly. ROM (read-only) memory on the other hand
  maintians data without power and can't be easly writen on. There are three common types of memory:
  >li> ROM- Read only memory<\li>
  <li> DRAM- Dynamic random memory<\li>
  <li> SPAM-Static RAM<\li>
  
  <p> <p>
  ROM is permantet to semi-permanet data that stays if the power is turned off.
  ROM BIOS is on the ROM chip, which is on the motherboard. Most OS use electrically erasable programmable ROM, which is a type of flash memory.
  <p><p>
  DRAM is mostly used for the main memory. DRAM is dense, meaning that you can put quite a few bits on to the main chip. The main flaw, however, is that it constantly changes, as well as
  constantly being refreshed. THe standed time for that is about 15ms (millisecond), all rows at this time will automaticly be read.
  <p><p>
  <h2> IMPORTANT <P>
  Increasing the thime between refresh cycles (tREF) to increase speed cna cause random soft memory errors to appear. Soft errors are not caused by a faulty chip.
  </h2>
  DRAM is used because of it's cheap and can be densly packed. (i.e. more memory) However, it is slower then a PC's processor.
  <p> <p>
  STRAM doesn't need to be constantly refreshed, and has a speed of access of 0.25ns or less. That means your processor can run 4 GHz or faster.
  But, SRAM is not good for PC memory, it can be used to get better perforamce though, by using it as a cache memory.
  <p> To understand cache and main memory, look to see where they fit in the overall system architecture.
  <p> Now on to the difference between logical and physical memory.<p>
  The difference between a logical and physical is slight and something that most users do not need to know. But from an IT perspective it can help with 
  knowing what the computer is capable of doing. <p>
  <p>Physical Memory, which is also referred to as the physical storage or the real storage, is usually a term describing the 
  total amount of memory that is currently installed in the computer. i.e., if a computer has two 34MB memory module installed, 
  then the computer has a total of 68 physical memory. The physical memory normally is made from Random Access Memory (RAM) chips and the computer’s hard drives. 
  RAM is the total amount of memory installed on a computer.

<p>Logical Memory is the address space that is assigned to a logical partition, which the operating system perceives as its main 
memory. For a logical partition that uses shared memory, a subset of the logical memory is used to back up the physical main 
storage and whatever the remaining logical memory is left over is kept in auxiliary storage. To update a physical memory on a computer is relatively simple. 
As long as it is upgradable (some computers, phones, and tablets are no upgradable) you can go anywhere online or in person and get another memory chip. 
In contrast, the logical memory generally does not get upgraded as it is not needed.

<h2> Chapter  18
  <p> <h2> Power</h2>
</h2>
<p> <p> 
<h2> PRIMARY FUNCTION AND OPERATION</h2
The basic idea of a power supply is to convert electrical power available at the wall socket to that which the computer circuitry can actually use. The regular power supply is designed either 120V (normal) to 60Hz AC (alternating current) or 240V (normal) and 50Hz AC power into +3.3v, +5v AMD +2v (direct current) power. Some requires you to switch between input ranges but others have an auto-switch.
Power supply is described as a constant voltage switching power supply unit (PSU), which is defined as follows:
	Constant voltage means power supply puts out the same voltage to the computer’s internal components, no matter the voltage of AC that is currently running it or the capacity (wattage) of the power supply.
	Switching is talking about the design and power regulation techniques that most suppliers use. Compared to other types of power types, this design allows an efficient and inexpensive power source and generates a minimum amount of heat. It also maintains a small size and lo price.
VOLTAGE RAILS
The PSU normally supplies +3.3V, +5V, and +12V to the system. These voltage is often called rails, referring to the fact that although there are multiple wires are used, if all of the current were carried over a single wire, and the wire and terminals, connectors and even the traces on the circuit boards would all have to be extremely large and thick to handle the load. Instead, it is cheaper and more efficient to spread the load out among multiple smaller and thinner wires, i.e. rails.
The digital electronic components and circuits in the system (motherboard, adapter cards, and disk drive logic boards) typically use the +3.3V or the +5V power, where the motors (disk drive motors and any fans) use the +12V power. Additionally, voltage regulators in the motherboard or in other components convert these standard voltages to others as necessary. 
<p> <p>
<li> SIMM =         Single line Memory Module
<li> DIMM =         Dual inline Memory Module
<li> PCI =			    Peripheral Component Interconnect
<li> AGP =		    	Accelerated Graphics Port
<li> ISA =          Industry Standard Architecture
<p> <p>
If it helps, think of a rail as a disconnect power circuit, kind of like a power supply within the power supply.
<p><p>
<p><p>
<p><p>
<h2>VOLTAGE REGULATORS</h2>
<p> <p>
Older DDR (double data rate) dual inline memory modules (DIMMS) and Rambus inline memory (RIMMS) require 2.5V, where the DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMS require 1.8V and 1.5V, legacy AGP 4x/8x cards require 1.5V, and current PCI Express cards use only 0.8V different signaling<p> 
– all of which are supplied by simple on the board regulators. Processors also require a variety of voltage (as low as 1.3V or less) that are supplied by a sophisticated voltage regulator module (VRM) that is either built in or plugged in to the motherboard. <p>
You’ll commonly find three or more different voltage regulator circuits on the modern motherboard.
<p><p>
NEGATIVE DC VOLTAGE
<p><p>
Positive voltage seems to power everything, and in reality they do. -5 were removed from the ATX12V 1.3 and later specifications. The only reason that it remained in the power supply designs was for backwards compatibility. 
<p><p>
THE POWER GOOD SIGNAL 
<p><p>
The Power_Good signal is sometimes called the Power_OK or PWR_OK is a +5V (normal) active high signal (with a variation from +2.4V through +6.0V generally being considered satisfactory) that is supplied to the motherboard when the power supply has passed its internal self-tests and the output voltage have stabilized.<p> 
This typically takes anywhere from 100ms to 500ms (0.1-0.5 seconds) after you turn on the power supply switch. It then sends the PWR_OK signal to the motherboard where the processor timer chip that controls the rest line to the processor receives it.
In the absence of PWR_OK, the timer chip holds the reset line on the processor, which prevents the system from running under bad or unstable power conditions. When the timer chip receives the PWR_OK signal it releases the rest and the processor beings <p>
executing whatever code is at address FFF0h (occupied by the motherboard ROM).<p>
<p><p>
POWER SUPPLY FORM FACTORS
<p><p>
Industry-standard form factors have many perks, they have interchangeable parts so that there is a better range of choices for replacement parts when you need them, which means more often than not, better pricing. Plugging the power supply connectors into the motherboard is one thing, <p>
but for the power supply to work in the system, it must physically fit inside the chassis or case-and that is what is different in form factors.
