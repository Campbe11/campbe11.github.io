   <p> History of the PC"<p>
    
   <p> "The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617 <p>
   <p> when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages <p>
    <p>from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet. <p>
    <p>Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012 <p>
    <p>Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT."

    <p> "Chapter 2 <p>
    <p> PC Components" <p>
    
    <p> "First off, let us start with a simple question. What is a PC? Most PCs are basied off of the idea of IBM's PC released in
    19841. The next question is who controls the software. The not so surprising answer is Microsoft for the operating system (OS) <p>
    A lot of the difference between a PC and Mac comes down to the OS that the computer runs. Mac is unique (besides the style) is <p>
    the ability to run OS X. <p>
    <p> Next is the Hardware, and it may surprise some that Intel dominates the entire worldwide semiconductor industry. Intel is <p>
    bigger then Samsung and AMD.
