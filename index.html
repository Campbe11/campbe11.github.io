   <p> History of the PC"<p>
    
   <p> "The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617 <p>
   <p> when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages <p>
    <p>from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet. <p>
    <p>Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012 <p>
    <p>Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT."
