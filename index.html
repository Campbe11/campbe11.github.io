   <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
   <p>History of the PC" <br>
    
   <p> "The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617
   when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages
    from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet.
    Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012
    Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT."

    <h2> Chapter 2 </h2>
    <p> PC Components" <br>
    <p> <p>
    First off, let us start with a simple question. What is a PC? Most PCs are based off of the idea of IBM's PC released in
    1984. The next question is who controls the software. The not so surprising answer is Microsoft for the operating system (OS) 
    A lot of the difference between a PC and Mac comes down to the OS that the computer runs. Mac is unique (besides the style) is 
    the ability to run OS X. <p>
    <p> Next is the Hardware, and it may surprise some that Intel dominates the entire worldwide semiconductor industry. Intel is 
    bigger then Samsung and AMD.  Next is a White box. A term that you may not recognize, but you may already now. A white box is a generic PC that "assembled from a
     collection of industry-standard, commercially available components. These companies do not manufacture systems, they assemble them.   <p> System types. Most go by two different ways to categorize them. 
     One is by design/width of the processor bus and the width of the internal registers. <p>

    <p>*These may be on the motherboard or processor.
    

<h2> Chapter 3 </h2>
<p> Processor types
Processors has changed quite a bit since the first PC that came out in 1981, and the evolution has
focused on 4 points.
<li> Increasing the transitor count and dencity </li>
<li> Increasing the clock speed</li>
<li> Increasing the size of internal bits </li>
<li> Increasing the number of cores </li>

<p> In 1985 Intel came out with Intel 386 processor. It had a 32-bit architecture and 275,000 transitors. 
This chip could do more then five million instructions per second. In 1989 Intel released the 486 processor. The 486 processor had 1.2 million trnasistors and the first ever built-in
math comprocessor. Then in 1993 Intel again released the first P5 Family called Pentiumm setting new performance standards with the performance
of the previous 486 processor. P6, the first processor in the (686) family, called the Pentuim Pro was introduced in 1995.
AMD introduced the Athlon in 1999 to compete with Intel in the high-end desktop PC market.
2002 saw Intel release Pentuim 4 running at 3.06 GHz, the first processor to break the 3GHz barrier. In 2003 AMD released
the first 64-bit PC processor: Athlon 64.In 2005 both Intel and AMD released the first dual-core processor.
2006 Intel reviled a new processor family called the Core 2, and this was mostly baed off of previous M/Core processors.
AMD released the Phenom 2 series, and Intel came out with the "Sandy Bridge", second generation of Core i-series.
In 2012 Intel put out the third generation Core i-series. As a side note, AMD processors are used by many companies as well as used in non-Windows smartphones.
<p>
<p> <p>
<h2> Chapter 4 Motherboards</h2>
<p> <p>
<p>The motherboards are a major component of a computer, everything connects it determines what you can do and how fast you can do it.
The ATX has improved on the Baby-AT and LDX motherboard designs, such as:
<li> Built in high external I/O connector pannel</li>
<li> Single main keyed internal power supply connector</li>
<li> Relocated CPU and memory </li>
<li> Relocated internal I/O connectors </li>
<li> Improved cooling </li>
<li> Lower cost to manufacture</li>
   
     <p> <p>
     The ATX form factor was a long stride away from the motherboard form factos in the past. ATX combined what was considered the best from Baby-AT and LPX motherboard, with
     new features put in. The placement also changed, the motherboard was placed futher away from the drive bay, making the CPU, memory, and internal drive 
     made it simple to access and not mess up the bus slots. The physical componets are as follows:
     <li> The full size ATX is 12 inches wide and 9.6 inches deep. (305mmx244mm)
     <li> By contrast the Mini-ATX board is 11.2 inches and 8.2 inches. (284mmx208mm)
     
     <p> If you go to www.formfactors.org you can get spects and more information on ATX.<p>
  
  <h2> Chapter 5 BIOS</h2>
  <p> <p>
  <p> BIOS is an acronym that stands for basic input/output system. Most people know ir as device drivers or simply drivers.
  There are three main types of BIOS.
  <li> Motherboard ROM<\li>
  <li> Adapter card ROMs (found on video card)a<\li>
  <li> Loaded into RAM from disk(device Drivers)<\li>
  
  <p><p>
  POST (power on self test) loads an OS (operating system) then calls on low-level routines to interact with system hardware.
  <p> The motherboard ROM (read-only memory) compines any adapter card ROMs, and puts it in with the collective functionality.<p>
  <p> Drivers are loaded from a disk to RAM and then joined in BIOS so that it is there if needed. Memory is memory (to your computer) so as long as a routine exist and is known, the computer will use it.<p>
  <p><p>
  The BIOS id s mix of the motherboard ROM and adapter card ROM, and the device drivers loaded from a disk into RAM. Adding in new drivers to
  ROM is tricky, as they are hard to change and have limited amount of space. The PC architecture only holds up to 256KB max amount of ROM space.<p>
  <p>Applications talk to the OS by what is called application programming interface (API). API is different depending on your OS/ API only interacts with
  the OS, not the hardware. The OS then comunicates with BIOS in the driver layer. As many know, a OS can run on any type of hardware.
  The most differnce between the hardware is the system itself. BIOS covers up what the difference is.<p>
  <p> <p>
  <p><p>
  <h2> Chapter 6 Memory</h2>
  <p> The memory of a computer is something that is important for any computer. Memory is often where the processor is working at any given time.
  The main memory of any computer is RAM (Random Access Memory), which as the name imples, can be accessed randomly. ROM (read-only) memory on the other hand
  maintians data without power and can't be easly writen on. There are three common types of memory:
  >li> ROM- Read only memory<\li>
  <li> DRAM- Dynamic random memory<\li>
  <li> SPAM-Static RAM<\li>
  
  <p> <p>
  ROM is permantet to semi-permanet data that stays if the power is turned off.
  ROM BIOS is on the ROM chip, which is on the motherboard. Most OS use electrically erasable programmable ROM, which is a type of flash memory.
  <p><p>
  DRAM is mostly used for the main memory. DRAM is dense, meaning that you can put quite a few bits on to the main chip. The main flaw, however, is that it constantly changes, as well as
  constantly being refreshed. THe standed time for that is about 15ms (millisecond), all rows at this time will automaticly be read.
  <p><p>
  <h2> IMPORTANT <P>
  Increasing the thime between refresh cycles (tREF) to increase speed cna cause random soft memory errors to appear. Soft errors are not caused by a faulty chip.
  </h2>
  DRAM is used because of it's cheap and can be densly packed. (i.e. more memory) However, it is slower then a PC's processor.
  <p> <p>
  STRAM doesn't need to be constantly refreshed, and has a speed of access of 0.25ns or less. That means your processor can run 4 GHz or faster.
  But, SRAM is not good for PC memory, it can be used to get better perforamce though, by using it as a cache memory.
  <p> To understand cache and main memory, look to see where they fit in the overall system architecture.
  <p> Now on to the difference between logical and physical memory.<p>
  The difference between a logical and physical is slight and something that most users do not need to know. But from an IT perspective it can help with 
  knowing what the computer is capable of doing. <p>
  <p>Physical Memory, which is also referred to as the physical storage or the real storage, is usually a term describing the 
  total amount of memory that is currently installed in the computer. i.e., if a computer has two 34MB memory module installed, 
  then the computer has a total of 68 physical memory. The physical memory normally is made from Random Access Memory (RAM) chips and the computer’s hard drives. 
  RAM is the total amount of memory installed on a computer.

<p>Logical Memory is the address space that is assigned to a logical partition, which the operating system perceives as its main 
memory. For a logical partition that uses shared memory, a subset of the logical memory is used to back up the physical main 
storage and whatever the remaining logical memory is left over is kept in auxiliary storage. To update a physical memory on a computer is relatively simple. 
As long as it is upgradable (some computers, phones, and tablets are no upgradable) you can go anywhere online or in person and get another memory chip. 
In contrast, the logical memory generally does not get upgraded as it is not needed.

<h2> Chapter  18
  <p> <h2> Power</h2>
</h2>
<p> <p> 
<h2> PRIMARY FUNCTION AND OPERATION</h2
The basic idea of a power supply is to convert electrical power available at the wall socket to that which the computer circuitry can actually use. The regular power supply is designed either 120V (normal) to 60Hz AC (alternating current) or 240V (normal) and 50Hz AC power into +3.3v, +5v AMD +2v (direct current) power. Some requires you to switch between input ranges but others have an auto-switch.
Power supply is described as a constant voltage switching power supply unit (PSU), which is defined as follows:
	Constant voltage means power supply puts out the same voltage to the computer’s internal components, no matter the voltage of AC that is currently running it or the capacity (wattage) of the power supply.
	Switching is talking about the design and power regulation techniques that most suppliers use. Compared to other types of power types, this design allows an efficient and inexpensive power source and generates a minimum amount of heat. It also maintains a small size and lo price.
VOLTAGE RAILS
The PSU normally supplies +3.3V, +5V, and +12V to the system. These voltage is often called rails, referring to the fact that although there are multiple wires are used, if all of the current were carried over a single wire, and the wire and terminals, connectors and even the traces on the circuit boards would all have to be extremely large and thick to handle the load. Instead, it is cheaper and more efficient to spread the load out among multiple smaller and thinner wires, i.e. rails.
The digital electronic components and circuits in the system (motherboard, adapter cards, and disk drive logic boards) typically use the +3.3V or the +5V power, where the motors (disk drive motors and any fans) use the +12V power. Additionally, voltage regulators in the motherboard or in other components convert these standard voltages to others as necessary. 
<p> <p>
<li> SIMM =         Single line Memory Module
<li> DIMM =         Dual inline Memory Module
<li> PCI =			    Peripheral Component Interconnect
<li> AGP =		    	Accelerated Graphics Port
<li> ISA =          Industry Standard Architecture
<p> <p>
If it helps, think of a rail as a disconnect power circuit, kind of like a power supply within the power supply.
<p><p>
<p><p>
<p><p>
<h2>VOLTAGE REGULATORS</h2>
<p> <p>
Older DDR (double data rate) dual inline memory modules (DIMMS) and Rambus inline memory (RIMMS) require 2.5V, where the DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMS require 1.8V and 1.5V, legacy AGP 4x/8x cards require 1.5V, and current PCI Express cards use only 0.8V different signaling<p> 
– all of which are supplied by simple on the board regulators. Processors also require a variety of voltage (as low as 1.3V or less) that are supplied by a sophisticated voltage regulator module (VRM) that is either built in or plugged in to the motherboard. <p>
You’ll commonly find three or more different voltage regulator circuits on the modern motherboard.
<p><p>
NEGATIVE DC VOLTAGE
<p><p>
Positive voltage seems to power everything, and in reality they do. -5 were removed from the ATX12V 1.3 and later specifications. The only reason that it remained in the power supply designs was for backwards compatibility. 
<p><p>
THE POWER GOOD SIGNAL 
<p><p>
The Power_Good signal is sometimes called the Power_OK or PWR_OK is a +5V (normal) active high signal (with a variation from +2.4V through +6.0V generally being considered satisfactory) that is supplied to the motherboard when the power supply has passed its internal self-tests and the output voltage have stabilized.<p> 
This typically takes anywhere from 100ms to 500ms (0.1-0.5 seconds) after you turn on the power supply switch. It then sends the PWR_OK signal to the motherboard where the processor timer chip that controls the rest line to the processor receives it.
In the absence of PWR_OK, the timer chip holds the reset line on the processor, which prevents the system from running under bad or unstable power conditions. When the timer chip receives the PWR_OK signal it releases the rest and the processor beings <p>
executing whatever code is at address FFF0h (occupied by the motherboard ROM).<p>
<p><p>
POWER SUPPLY FORM FACTORS
<p><p>
Industry-standard form factors have many perks, they have interchangeable parts so that there is a better range of choices for replacement parts when you need them, which means more often than not, better pricing. Plugging the power supply connectors into the motherboard is one thing, <p>
but for the power supply to work in the system, it must physically fit inside the chassis or case-and that is what is different in form factors.

<h2>Magnetic Storage Principles</h2>
<a>Most permeant or semi-permanent computer data is stored magnetically, meaning a stream of binary computer data bits (0’s and 1’s) is stored by magnetizing tiny pieces of metal embedded on the surface of a disk or tape in a pattern that represents data. Later, this magnetic pattern can be read and converted back into the same original bits. This is the principle of magnetic storage and the overall chapter.</a>
<h2>History</h2>
<a>The history starts in June 1949, when a team of engineers and scientists began working on a new storage device. That storage device was the first magnetic storage device for computers and completely changed the industry. May 21, 1952, IBM released the IBM 726 Tape Unit with the IBM701 Defense Calculator, showing the shift from punch card calculators to electronic computers.</a>
<a>In September 13, 1956 another group in San Jose, Cali, announced the first computer disk storage system as part of the 305 RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) computer. The RAMAC could only hold 5MB of data on 50 disks, with a size of 24 inches in diameter. This random accessibility changed the effect of computer performance at that point, allowing to be stored and retrieved considerably faster than if it were on a tape.</a>
<a>In just over 60+ years the magnetic storage industry has moved quickly, now you can store 4TB or more in a 3 ½ inch drives that fit in to a single computer drive bay.</a>
<h2> Magnetic Fields and How They are Used</h2>
<a>All magnetic storage device is able to read and write data by electromagnetism. The basic idea behind it is that the physics state that of an electric current goes through a wire and a magnetic field is generated around the conductor. Keep in mind the electrons actually move from negative to positive, while we normally think they go in the other direction.</a>
<a>Electromagnetism started in 1819 by a Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted, when he found that a compass needle would deflect away from pointing north when brought close to a wire that held an electric current running through it. After the electricity was cut off, the needle went back to using the Earth’s magnetic field and was at north again.</a>
<a>Another effect of electromagnetism was found by Michael Faraday in 1831. He discovered that if a conductor is passed through a moving magnetic field, a current was created. As the polarity of the magnetic field changes so does the current’s flows direction.</a>
<a>The term flux is used to describe a magnetic field that has a specific direction or polarity. At the top of the surface, the medium moves under the drive head, which can generate something called a magnetic flux of a given polarity over a specific region of the medium. When the flow is flipped, the coils in the head is also flipped, so the magnetic field polarity or flux in the head gap.</a>
<a>A signal when reading 0 volts unless the head detects a magnetic flux transition, in which it generates a positive or negative pulse accordingly.</a>
<a>There has been several types of heads that have been used:</a>
<a></a>
<li> ۝	Ferrite
<li> ۝	Metal-In-Gap (MIG)
<li> ۝	Thin-Film (TF)
<li> ۝	Magneto-resistive (MR)
<li> ۝	Giant magneto-resistive (GMR)
<li> ۝	Perpendicular magnetic  recording (PMR
<h2> Ferrite</h2>
<a></a>
<a>Ferrite heads, the original type used and based off of IBM 30-30 Winchester drive. These types have an iron-oxide core wrapped in electromagnetic coils. The drive generates a magnetic field by energizing the coils or passing a magnetic field neat them. This allows them to have a full read//write capability. Ferrite heads are large and weighs more than the thin-film heads and because of that they require a larger floating height to prevent contact with the disk while it is rotating.</a>
<a> </a>
<h2> Metal-In-Gap</h2>
<a>MIG heads are purposely enhanced version of the composite ferrite design. In MIG heads, a metal substance is applied to the head’s recording gap. Two versions of MIF heads are available, single sided and double sided. Single sided MIG heads are designed with a layer of magnetic allot placed amount the trailing edge of the gap. Double sided MIG designs apply the lay to both sides of the gap. The metal alloy is applied through a vacuum deposition process called sputtering.</a>
<h2> Thin-Film</h2>
<a>Thin-Film heads are manufactured much the same way as a semiconductor chip- through a photolithographic processes. This process creates many thousands of heads in a single circular wafer and produces a small, high-quality product.</a> 
<h2> Magneto-resistive</h2>
<a></a>
<a>Magneto-resistive heads, sometimes called as the anisotropic magneto resistant (AMR) heads, are capable of increasing density four times or greater as compared to the previous inductive only heads. IBM introduced the first commercially available drive with MR heads in 1991, in a 1GB 3 ½ inch model, and others quickly followed suit.</a>  
<a>MR heads are more costly and complex to make then the older TF heads because of these additional components and manufacture steps required:
<a>Additional wires must be run to and from the head to carry the sense current.
<a>Four to six more masking steps are required.
<a>Because of the MR heads being so sensitive, they are susceptible to stray magnetic fields and have to have additional shielding.
<a></a>
<h2> Giant Magneto Resistive</h2>
<a>When working on a way to get more density, IBM announced a new type of head in 1997. Called the Giant Magneto Resistive heads, they are smaller than standard MR heads but are named for the GMR effect on which they are based. The design, while similar, has additional layers replaced the single NiFe layer in the conventional MR design. In MR heads, a single NiFe film changes resistance in response to a flux reversal on the disk. In GMR heads, two films (disconnected by a thin copper conducting layer) performed this function.</a>
<a>The GMR mentioned previously was first discovered in 1988, in crystal samples that were exposed to high-power magnetic fields (1,000 times more used in hard disk drives). Two scientist named Peter Gruenberg of Julich, Germany, and Albert Fert of Paris discovered that large resistance changes were occurring in materials composed of alternating thin layers of various metallic elements. The important part of GMR is that a layer of nonmagnetic metal lays between two layers of magnetic metals. One of the layers is pinned, meaning that ut has a forced magnetic orientation. The other is free, meaning that it is free to move orientation or alignment.</a>
<a>IBM revealed the first commercially available drive using GMR heads (a 16.8GB 3 ½-inch drive) in December 1997. Ever since then, GMR heads are standard in most 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch drives.</a>
<a>2007 saw Hitachi develop a giant magneto-resistive head using perpendicular current that supports areal densities of up to 1Tbits/sq. inch or more. These are called current perpendicular-to-the-plane giant magneto-resistive beads or CPP-GMR for short, and started appearing on the market around 2011.</a>

<h2> Definition of a Hard Disk</h2>
<a>The hard disk drive (HDD) is a highly important but mystifying part of a computer system. HDDs are sealed units used for nonvolatile storage. Nonvolatile or semi permanent storage means that a storage device keeps the data with no power supply. Because HDDs store crucial programming and data, the consequences of failures are usually serious. To build, maintain, service, or upgrade a PC system properly, it is important to know how hard disk functions.</a>
<a>HDDs hold rigid, circular platters, usually constructed of aluminum or glass. These platters cannot be flexed or bent, thus the term hard disk. In most drives you can’t remove the platters, which is why someone may refer to them as fixed disk drives.</a>
<h2> History of Hard Drives</h2>
<a>The first ever hard drive appeared in 1957, Cyril Northcote Parkinson published his famous compilation of essays called Parkinson’s Law, which begins with the words, “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” A corollary of Parkinson’s most famous “law” can be applied to hard drives: “Data expands so as to fill the space available for its storage.” This, obviously, means that it doesn’t matter how large of a hard drive you have, you will fill it.</a>
<a>Today, we have hard drive disks that have a rate of 550 MBps or more, looking back that is more than 1,000 to 5, 5000 faster. Up until the advent of high-performance Solid-State Drives (SSDs) these interface were typically much faster than the individual drives they supported, meaning that the true transfer rate you will see was almost entirely limited by the driver and not the interface you choose. SSDs have changed the system and have been pushing the industry to develop faster interfaces. The modern interfaces have bandwidth to spare for future developments and advances in hard disk technology.</a>
<h2>Form Factors</h2>
<a>The PC industry has always been about standards, with disk drives, it is evident that in the physical and electrical form factors that comprise modern drives. By using this standard, you can purchase a system or chassis from one company and yet have the physical and electrical components come from a different manufacture. Form Factors ensure that available drives will fit in the bay, the screw holes will line up, and the standard cables and connections will plug in. Form Factors are established in a few different ways. A few are simply because of high popularity, and others copy the form. In other cases there various groups or committees have been formed to dctate3 certain industry standards. It is really up to the companies that make applicable products to create them to conform to these standards.</a>
<h2>5 12 Inch Drive</h2>
<a>Shugart introduced the 5 ¼ floppy drives along with the first 5 ¼ form factor in 1976. Seagate released the first 5 ¼ hard disk in 1980, predating IBM PC. IBM later used the Seagate ST-412 (10MB) drive in some of its PC-XT models, which were among the first PCs to be sold with hard drives built in.  The first portable systems (such as the original Compaq Portable) used these drives as well. Later, the 5 ¼ inch half height floppy drive and hard drives were introduced. This allowed two drives to fit in a bay originally designed for one. The 5 ¼ half-height factor is still used today as the form factor for optical drives and is the standard for large drive bays in all modern desktop PC chassis.</a>
<h2>3 ½ Inch Drive</h2>
<a>Sony actually was the one to first introduce the 3 ½ inch floppy drive in 1981, which used a smaller width and depth but had the same height as the 5 ¼ inch. These were called 3 ½ inch half height drives; even though there is no such thing as a full height 3 ½ drive. Rodime followed with the first 3 ½ half height hard disk in 1983. Afterwards, the 3 ½ floppy and hard drive would be reduced to only 1 inch which was just under the one-third original of 5 ¼ form factor (these were referred to by some as the 1/3 height drives). Today, the 1-inch version has become modern industry standard 3 ½ form factor.</a>
<h2>2 ½ Inch Drive</h2>
<a>PairieTek announced the 2 ½ inch form factor in 1988, which fit perfectly for laptop and notebook computers. So as laptop sales grew so did the sales of the 2 ½ inch drives. Despite PairieTek being the first with that form factor, other  drive manufactures quickly capitalized on the market by also bringing in their 2 ½ drives. In 1994 Conner Peripherals, Inc., paid $18 million for PairieTek’s drive, and they went out of business. Although the 2 ½ can be used for desktop computers, the 3 ½ inch drive still tops the market due to greater speed and capacity as well as lower cost. The 2 ½ drives have varying thickness or heights and many are restricted to how thick the drive can be. The most common thickness are as follows:</a>
<li> ۝	7mm
<li> ۝	8.5mm
<li> ۝	9.5mm
<li> ۝	12.5mm
<li> ۝	12.7mm
<li> ۝	17.0mm
<li> ۝	19.0mm
<h2>1.8 Inch Drive</h2>
<a>The 1.8 inch drive was first introduced in 1991, but it never really became popular. The main reason for making the 1.8 was to fit perfectly in the PC Card (PCMCIA) form factor, making it ideal for add on removable storage for laptop and notebook systems. The main reason why it never really took to the market was because it was slow to take shape and in 1998 an investment group called Mobile Storage bought Integral Peripherals (the company that made the product). There has been several companies that have made the 1.8, such as HP, Calluna, Toshiba, and Hitachi. HP exited the drive market completely in 1996, and Calluna creased operation in 2001. Toshiba released its 1.8 (which is available in the physical format of a Type II PC Card in 2000, and Hitachi entered the 1.8 market in 2003. Toshiba announced its last 1.8 drives in capacities of up to 320GB in 2009. There are no 1.8 HDDs currently being made, but they are still available in marketplace for repair and several manufactures are making SSDs in the 1.8 form factor.</a> 
<h2>I-Inch drive</h2>
<a>1998 saw IBM releasing a 1-inch drive called the Microdrive, incorporating a single platter about the size of a quarter. Seagates introduced a similar device in 2004. Microdrive capacities varied from 170MB to 12GB over the life of these products. The drives were available with several interfaces but the most popular was that of a Type 2 Compact Flash (CF) card. This means that the drives could be used in almost any device that took CF cards, including digital cameras, PDAs (personal digital assistants) and MP3 players such as the Apple iPod Mini. IBM’s drive division was sold to Hitachi in 2003 and combined with Hitachi’s storage technology as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. Hitachi and Seagate shifted out Microdive production after 2008 since by then flash-based CF cards had surpassed the Microdrive in capacity, performance, and price.</a>
<a>In 2004, Toshiba released the smallest drive to date: the 0.85-inch drive, which is about the size of a postage stamp and stores up to 4GB. This drive was designed for use in mobile phones, digital audio players, PDAs, digital still cameras, camcorders, and more. As with the Microdrive, these were also eventually stopped being made due to advances in flash memory.
