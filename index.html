    "Chapter 1
    History of the PC
    
    The major landmarks in computers are vast, and far reaching (further back then one would think.) The dates vary, from 1617
    when John Napier created 'Napirt's Bones' to 1943 when Thomas Flowers made the Colossus that decoded teleprinter messages
    from the German Army. Then there was 1969 when the Department of Defence establishes four nodes on the ARPAnet. 
    Shortly after that in 1975, Telenet (the first commercial packet-switching network and civilian of APAnet) was born. In 2012 
    Microsoft made availible a Intel prosessor based version of Windows 8 with Windows RT.
